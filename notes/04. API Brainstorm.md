# API Brainstorm

### [Google's APIs](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/)

All the Google services you can imagine.

### [Giant database of APIs](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory)

This is definitely worth skimming for some inspiration.

Also, did you know that  [Udacity has an API](https://catalog-api.udacity.com/v1/catalog)? It's available for anyone to use. We want to make it easy for developers to access and share our catalog of courses.  
Examples:  
`https://catalog-api.udacity.com/v1/catalog`  
`https://catalog-api.udacity.com/v1/courses`  
`https://catalog-api.udacity.com/v1/degrees`  
`https://catalog-api.udacity.com/v1/tracks`  
  
Supports "locale" parameter  
`https://catalog-api.udacity.com/v1/catalog?locale=en-US`  
`https://catalog-api.udacity.com/v1/catalog?locale=zh-cn`  
_Note: locale parameter is case-insensitive and defaults/has fallback to "en-us"_  
  
Supports Course/Degree lookup by key  
`https://catalog-api.udacity.com/v1/courses/cs101?locale=en-US`  
`https://catalog-api.udacity.com/v1/degrees/nd000?locale=zh-cn`
