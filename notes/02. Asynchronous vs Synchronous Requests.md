# Asynchronous vs Synchronous Requests

Before we start diving into asynchronous requests, let's consider some real-world scenarios that might require one.

Remember, an asynchronous request can be fired off  **at any time**  (before or after a page has loaded) and the response to an asynchronous request often includes HTML that can be dynamically inserted into a page.

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)  uses a lot of asynchronous requests so that the page almost never needs to refresh for users to see new content.

Take a moment to consider when Facebook might take advantage of asynchronous requests to load new content without refreshing the page. Think about user actions that might lead to asynchronous requests. For instance, when a user scrolls down in a business' page (like  [Udacity's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Udacity)), new stories get inserted into the page which never needs to refresh to show new content (more on this specific example in a moment). This is an example of an asynchronous request.

Here's some help:

-   **Scrolling down in the Newsfeed**: when you scroll down, new stories are automatically loaded.
-   **Loading the homepage when  _not_  signed in**: open  [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)  in  [Incognito Mode](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?source=gsearch)  to see what I mean.
-   **Posting a message on a friend's Timeline**: Does the page reload when you post? How does the page change after you hit "Post"?
-   **Clicking through a friend's pictures**: Does the page ever need to refresh when you are scrolling through a friend's pictures?
